# Email Spam Detection using NLP and Logistic Regression
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails or SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam). The model is trained on a labeled dataset from Kaggle.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stemming, stopword removal)
- Bag of Words (BoW) model for feature extraction
- Logistic Regression for binary classification
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy score
- Achieves over **97% accuracy** on test data

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Train/Test Split, Vectorizers)
